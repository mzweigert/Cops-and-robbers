# Graph-Theory

Project realized as part of the master's thesis, consisting of two modules:

`graphrodite` - library which performing the operation on [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics))
like creating them, finding cycles etc.

`cops-and-robber` - module containing algorithms related to the [cops-and-robbers game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pursuit-evasion), 
which calculating cops number needed to catch robber on given graphs.
